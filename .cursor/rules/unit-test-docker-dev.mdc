# Feature Unit Testing and Local Docker Development Requirements

This rule establishes requirements for feature development:
1. All features must have comprehensive unit tests
2. Local development must use containerized dependencies with Docker

## Unit Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Every new feature must have unit tests that cover at least 90% of the code
- All edge cases must be tested
- Tests must verify both success and failure paths

### Test Implementation
- Use Django's TestCase for database-related tests
- Use SimpleTestCase for tests that don't require database access
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test methods
- Name test methods clearly using `test_<function_name>_<scenario>`

### Test Verification
- All tests must pass before submitting a PR
- Include test coverage reports in PR descriptions
- Tests should run quickly (<10 seconds per test file)

## Local Development with Docker

### Docker Setup
- Use Docker Compose for local development environment
- Create separate containers for:
  - Django application
  - PostgreSQL/MySQL database
  - Redis (if needed)
  - Any other external services

### Database Configuration
- Replace production database connections with containerized equivalents
- Use environment variables for connection strings
- Include seed data scripts for development

### Example docker-compose.yml
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DEBUG=1
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
  
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### Implementation Guidelines
- All dependencies should be containerized
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Include setup scripts in the repository
- Document any special setup requirements

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests implemented for new feature
- [ ] Test coverage meets or exceeds 90%
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Docker setup works for local development
- [ ] Documentation updated
